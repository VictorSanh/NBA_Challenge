Data exploration
- PCA to visualize data -> Victor

First models (simple without temporal condition)
- SVM (with kernel) -> Margot
- Logistic regression -> Margot

First temporal dependece model
- Convolutional neural network -> Victor


Next
- RNN
- Feature engineering to capture temporal dependence
